This folder contains the sourcecode for a security bot to keep malware and unauthorised forwards out of your telegram groups.
It is a modulised python program which utilised the python-telegram-bot library.
Special thanks to @SroSorcxisto for the file_scanner function which is essential for the blocklist.
and also thanks to the python-telegram-bot staff.


NOTE: 
I have left the malicious_sites.txt blank for OBVIOUS reasons. It is intended to keep a list of toxic websites. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DEPLOY THIS BOT UNLESS YOU KNOW A BIT ABOUT CYBER-SECURITY!!
The allowlist contains some channels which might be recommended, but if you're deploying the bot you can wipe it and start again if you like, merely a suggestion.

THIS BOT DOES NOT TRACK ANY INDIVIDUAL USERS!! It only takes the telegram ID numbers of the silver key_bearers (people who are trusted admins)
It does however track the groups it's in (takes the groups username and ID) 


features:
*auto-blocks users forwarding unapproved telegram channels in your groups. Only trusted admins who are given the silver key may add or remove to the allowlist (transactions are logged in log-channel)
*blocks websites known for malware, phishing or any illegal activity - also bans the violator instantly.
*networks groups it resides in with the /chats command.
*able to remove it from groups which you don't approve of helping.
*ability to add or remove admin privilege for people over the bot.
